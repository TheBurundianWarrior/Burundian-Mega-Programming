					<p><img src="Florentin1.jpg" alt=""/>
Niyongere Florentin or Flo as called in the club is an 18 years old young man</br>
					
He stands out from the crowd with my creativity since a young age surmounted by a high interest in computer technology. He Co-founded this Computer Science club with his older Brother<a href="franck.html">Nijimbere Franck</a> when he was 13 years old.</br>
					At that time, the Brothers got the idea by observing the current Problems in their society. They associated with a neighbor<a href="arsene.html">Nduwayo Arsène</a> to form a club at the services of citizen and to help the youth not to diverge in the delinquency. When they started the Club, Flo was the youngest member of the club. But he acted as a leader in the Designing Department as well as a big contribution to the Bank project in the Club. His interest is oriented to Programming, Web Designing, 3D Designing, and Networking. He is a Fresh Graduated from High school at King David Academy in Rwanda. After his older Brother and the former BMP president went to pursue his studies, he took the place of President of the club.</br><br/>
